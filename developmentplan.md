## üîÑ Development Approach

### MVP Development Principles
1. **Iterative Development**
   - 2-week sprints
   - Continuous deployment
   - Regular user feedback

2. **Quality First**
   - Test-driven development
   - Code reviews
   - Automated testing
   - *API monitoring and fallback mechanisms*

3. **Scalability**
   - Containerized deployment
   - Horizontal scaling
   - Performance monitoring
   - *Resilient integration architecture*

## üîÑ Hybrid Approach Recommendation

For optimal balance of feasibility and innovation, we recommend:

1. **Phase 1 (MVP)**: Implement manual document upload with basic extraction as primary method, with pilot API integration for 1-2 major carriers
2. **Phase 2**: Expand automated extraction to 5+ major carriers while maintaining manual upload as fallback
3. **Phase 3**: Transition to API-first approach with manual upload as exception handling

This approach:
- Reduces initial development complexity while validating API integration approach
- Allows for faster initial market entry with reliable document processing
- Provides real-world validation before full automation investment
- Creates a robust fallback system for policies without API access
- Mitigates risks associated with external API dependencies

## üõ°Ô∏è Risk Management

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| API availability/changes | High | Implement source monitoring, fallback to manual upload |
| Rate limiting | Medium | Implement queuing, caching, and scheduled extraction |
| Authentication challenges | High | Develop carrier-specific auth modules, consider partnerships |
| Data inconsistency | Medium | Create robust normalization pipeline with validation |
| Legal/compliance issues | High | Consult legal experts, implement proper data handling policies |

## üìã Next Steps
1. [ ] Finalize MVP requirements
2. [ ] Set up development environment
3. [ ] Begin Sprint 1 development
4. [ ] Schedule weekly demo/review sessions
5. [ ] *Initiate carrier API research and documentation*

## üìù Notes
