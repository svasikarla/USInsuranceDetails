## 🔍 Monitoring Strategy

### 1. Application Performance Monitoring (APM)

#### Backend Monitoring
```python
# monitoring.py
import time
import logging
from functools import wraps
from prometheus_client import Counter, Histogram, Gauge

# Metrics
REQUEST_COUNT = Counter('http_requests_total', 'Total HTTP requests', ['method', 'endpoint', 'status'])
REQUEST_DURATION = Histogram('http_request_duration_seconds', 'HTTP request duration')
ACTIVE_USERS = Gauge('active_users_total', 'Number of active users')
PROCESSING_QUEUE_SIZE = Gauge('processing_queue_size', 'Number of documents in processing queue')

def monitor_endpoint(func):
    @wraps(func)
    async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        try:
            result = await func(*args, **kwargs)
            REQUEST_COUNT.labels(method='POST', endpoint=func.__name__, status='success').inc()
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            REQUEST_COUNT.labels(method='POST', endpoint=func.__name__, status='error').inc()
            raise
        finally:
            REQUEST_DURATION.observe(time.time() - start_time)
    return wrapper
```

#### Frontend Monitoring
```typescript
// monitoring.ts
interface PerformanceMetric {
  name: string;
  value: number;
  timestamp: Date;
}

class PerformanceMonitor {
  private metrics: PerformanceMetric[] = [];

  trackPageLoad(pageName: string) {
    const navigation = performance.getEntriesByType('navigation')[0] as PerformanceNavigationTiming;
    this.recordMetric(`page_load_${pageName}`, navigation.loadEventEnd - navigation.fetchStart);
  }

  trackUserAction(action: string, duration: number) {
    this.recordMetric(`user_action_${action}`, duration);
  }

  private recordMetric(name: string, value: number) {
    this.metrics.push({
      name,
      value,
      timestamp: new Date()
    });
    
    // Send to monitoring service
    this.sendToMonitoring({ name, value, timestamp: new Date() });
  }
}
```

### 2. Business Metrics Tracking
